Aimi project:
I am looking at the way humans learn in my approach to the design of the aimi program.  Humans learn through repetition, while programs do not learn.  What programs do is more a kin to rote memorization. 
Programs are told something is either 0 or 1 and there is no disputing it mathematically.  Humans some times take a long time to learn something and that is the model that I will be attempting to 
incorporate into the design of the aimi program.  Aimi will have a count associated with a particular word each time aimi is exposed to this word it will increase the counter to indicate that it is 
in the process of learning.  each word / concept / procedure that aimi must committ to memory will also have this number associated with it.  so that it can evaluate the most appropriate response based
on the number of times it has seen the indicated object in an appropriate form.  each word / concept / procedure will have a different numberical difficulty rating to learn and be assigned to the understood group 
in its appropriate category and usage.

there are three basic classes that we are going to begin with, and these are :
1. Greetings
2. conversation Body
3. farewells

additionally there will be support classes that will have to be used during the creation of the Greeting class and that will be used by each of the main Classes.  These helper classes will consist of:
1. Inputs and Outputs - this is the portion of the program that controls interaction between the program and the user.
2. Data Access - this is the portion of the program that provides the conduit between the Inputs and Outputs and the store of knowledge.
3. Procedures - this is the portion of the program that provides the appropriate timing for storing the data, recalling the data, and using the data.

as we run into roadblocks toward the goal more classes may be added and the structure of the aimi program may be modified to meet the needs of the future design requirements.
